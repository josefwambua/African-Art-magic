## principles of designing a recommendation system ##

Personalized art recommendation involves using data and algorithms to suggest artworks that are likely to appeal to a particular user. Here's a breakdown of what it entails:

Data Collection
User Preferences: Gather information about the user's interests, favorite artists, styles, and themes 2.
Interaction History: Track which artworks the user has viewed, liked, or interacted with 2.
Search Queries: Analyze the terms users search for when looking for art.
Demographic Data: Collect information about the user's age, location, education level, etc., if available 2.
Algorithm Implementation
Content-Based Filtering: Compare artworks based on attributes like style, color palette, subject matter, etc. 2.
Collaborative Filtering: Analyze patterns in user behavior across the entire user base to find similarities 2.
Hybrid Approach: Combine content-based and collaborative filtering methods for more accurate recommendations 2.
Recommendation Generation
Scoring System: Assign relevance scores to artworks based on the collected data and chosen algorithm 2.
Ranking: Sort artworks by their scores to determine the top recommendations 2.
Diversification: Ensure a mix of familiar and unfamiliar artworks to keep the experience engaging 2.
Implementation Steps
Design the database schema to store user profiles, artwork metadata, and interaction data 2.
Implement algorithms for data analysis and recommendation generation 2.
Integrate the recommendation system into the AR interface 2.
Continuously update and refine the recommendations based on user interactions.

### database
1.User profile - UserId(pk), name, email, gender and age(Demographic info), preferences, (favorite genres,categories)

2. Item - itemId(pk), title,description,attributes(genre, price, release date)

3.Interaction - interactionId(pk), userId(fk), itemId(fk), action(view, like, purchase),timestamp(Dat and time).
